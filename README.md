# Container Widget

The `Container`widget in Flutter allows you to create a box with a specified width, height, and decoration. You can use the `Container` widget to add padding, borders, and backgrounds to your widgets.

In this program, we use the `Container` widget to create a box that is centered on the screen and has a red background color. The `Container` widget also contains a `Text` widget that displays the text "Hello, World!" in the center of the box.

The properties that can be set on a `Container` widget include:

- `alignment` The alignment of the child within the container.
- `padding` The padding around the child.
- `color` The background color of the container.
- `width` The width of the container.
- `height` The height of the container.
- `decoration` The decoration of the container, which can include a border, background, and shadows.
